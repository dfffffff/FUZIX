This is a test tree for a configuration using banked memory (N8VEM 680x0
style)


TODO
- Make bankfixed support only writing out used areas of memory

Look at bankfixed/bankfixed32 split - put the smarts in bankfixed32 and then
look at a proper swap allocator so we don't waste tons of memory.

- Write the bank copy routines (copy needed bits zero rest and optimise)
- Write optimised udata copier ? (movem based and reverse ?)

- Save restore bank on interrupt entry/exit
