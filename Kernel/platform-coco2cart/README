COCO2
=====

(Work in progress)

COCO or Dragon 64 with an IDE port, cartridge and 64K of RAM

Supported hardware:
	IDE (Cloud9 or compatible set at FF50) with either built in
		cartridge RAM or separate cartridge
	COCO SDC (in progress)

Disk Layout
===========

At the moment partitions are not handled. Instead each minor number
corresponds to a 32MB slice of disc. Slice 0 holds the kernel image and
the rest is used for swapping processes. Slice 1 then normally holds the
first file system and so on. Add 128 for the second disc. Remember to keep
all of them under the offset you have set in the HDBDOS ROM for your disk
basic floppy images.

TODO: Now we have a bit more room, add minimal partition support for at
least primary partitions.

Memory Map
==========

User View
=========
0000-00FF	Interrupt stack
0100-01FF	Vectors plus the swap stack
0200-19FF	Display
1A00-1BFF	udata/stack
1C00-7FFF	Common, data and some kernel code
8000-FDFF	User space
FE00-FEFF	Free
FF00-FFFF	I/O etc

Kernel Mode View
================
0000-00FF	Interrupt stack
0100-01FF	Vectors plus swap stack
0200-19FF	Display
1A00-1BFF	udata/stack
1C00-7FFF	Common, data and some kernel code
8000-BFFF	ROM
C000-FEFF	Kernel
FF00-FFFF	I/O etc


Emulating in XRoar
==================

Needs the IDE patches

TODO
====

Fix use of CONFIG_LEGACY_EXEC in the devsdc driver

Make the boot loader robust (timeout handling)
Add hash of code not just simple magic - so we know bits match
Merge coco and IDE boot code so it works out which is present

Support for a real time clock and clock locking

We should be totally clean now on FIR blocking, so audio might
actually be doable if not doing drivewire.

We have about 2K left to try and jam those bits in which might just about be
enough to add support for very minimal MBR parsing and offsets. That would
be a big improvement.

Automatically pick swap according to whether IDE or SDC is present.


To Test
=======

Build the image and you'll get a fuzix.ide and fuzix.rom

In the xroar directory where you have a hard disc image do

dd if=/tmp/fuzix.ide of=hd0.img bs=512 seek=3 conv=notrunc
/opt/xroaride/bin/xroar -default-machine dragon64 -cart ide -cart-rom fuzix.rom

exec 49152

enjoy
