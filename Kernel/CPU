Each CPU has its own cpu subdirectory

	cpu-$name/

In that should be

cpu.h
	Types and definitions specific to the processor

rules.mk
	Cross compiler options and settings

image.mk
	General rules to build the final binary image


The following other per CPU files currently have leaked outside of the CPU
directory and will eventually move

lowlevel-$cpu.[sS]
	Low level function implementations that are common across all
platforms using that processor type

usermem_std-$cpu.[sS]
	Standard implementation of user/kernel memory access functions for
this processor type (may be blank)

kernel-$cpu.def
	Assembler constants and the like used to access structure offsets
shared between the C and assembler code.


Other CPU specific files can be placed in the cpu directory and referenced
as needed. The lowlevel code can also be C or assembler as best suits that
platform.


Types and definitions: cpu.h

The following standard types should be provided, either directly from a
compiler header or in cpu.h

	uint32_t
	int32_t
	uint16_t
	int16_t
	uint8_t
	int8_t
	size_t

The following additional types are used by FUZIX

	arg_t		-	a syscall argument (signed)
	uarg_t		-	a syscall argument (unsigned)
	usize_t		-	size_t for a userspace pointer
	susize_t	-	ditto, signed
	uaddr_t		-	a userspace address
	uptr_t		-	the size of a userspace pointer

	irqflags_t	-	a suitable type to hold the IRQ status

	clock_t		-	used for times()

	time_t		-	holds unix time split into a high/low part
				according to byte order. Not the same as
				user space.

	ticks_t		-	clock_t with a 16bit low/high split in
				CPU byte order

Althouh not tested the uptr_t type is there to support mixed pointer size
kernel/user space. To allow for this ugetp and uputp should be defined to
the correct uget/put size for a pointer (or provided)

EMAGIC			-	16bit platforms only (magic numbers)
EMAGIC_2		-	define as EMAGIC if only one


staticfast		-	define as blank unless you have a CPU that
				is much happier accessing memory from fixed
				addresses. Intended to make the Z80 port
				a bit tighter


POINTER32		-	set if pointers are 32bit

used(x)			-	indicate to the compiler that x is used

BIG_ENDIAN		-	set for big endian processor


Some of the other defines currently present are obsolete including the
banking ones and __fastcall__
