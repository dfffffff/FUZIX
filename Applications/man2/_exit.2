_EXIT(2)
## NAME
_exit - exit a process freeing its resources
## SYNOPSIS
*#include <unistd.h>*

*int _exit*(*int* status);
## DESCRIPTION
Upon calling this function the calling process immediately terminates and frees
up resources. The status value is returned back to the waiting parent via the
*waitpid* call.

The _exit call does not perform any cleanup specified by *atexit*(3) nor do any
standard I/O cleanup. Processes would normally exit via the *exit*(3) library
function.

When a process exits it frees its resources and then enters zombie state until
the parent waits for it, unless the parent is ignoring notifications about child
processes, in which case it exits completely and the reported status is lost.
## RETURN VALUE
This function does not return.
## CONFORMING TO
UZI, POSIX.1-2001
##NOTES
While the exit status argument is an *int* only the low 8bits of the status
passed in exit will be provided to the parent.
## SEE ALSO
*exit*(3),*fork*(2),*waitpid*(2).
